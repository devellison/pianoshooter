# PianoShooter v1.1
![Screenshot of Pianoshooter 1](doc/sample1.png)

PianoShooter is a visualizer written for the [ZGameEditor](https://github.com/VilleKrumlinde/zgameeditor " ZGameEditor") Visualizer 
used in [FL Studio](http://image-line.com "FL Studio").

It displays a Piano-roll style keyboard and draws notes for MIDI events it receives.

## <a name="Overview"/>Overview
To use PianoShooter, simply take the `PianoShooter.zgeobject` file and place it in the `Effects/Midi` directory 
for ZGameEditor Visualizer in FL Studio.

- On Windows, that will usually be `C:\Program Files (x86)\Image-Line\FL Studio\Plugins\Fruity\Effects\ZGameEditor Visualizer\Effects\MIDI`.

See more information in the  [FL Studio manual.](https://www.image-line.com/fl-studio-learning/fl-studio-online-manual/html/plugins/ZGameEditor%20Visualizer.htm#ZGE_addfx "FL Studio manual.")

As of version 1.0, I think it's generally useable and will try to minimize disruption of parameters (so it keeps working right in existing projects if you update it).

1. Add the ZGameEditor Visualizer to a mixer track (I generally put it on the Master track before any limiters)

    ![Mixer with ZGEV](doc/mixer1.png)

2. Make sure that ZGameEditor Visualizer is accepting MIDI on a MIDI Port. Remember which port you set it to.

    ![ZGEV Settings](doc/zgev_midi.png)

3. Add a "PianoShooter" Layer on the main tab of ZGameEditor Visualizer.
4. Set a channel up to send MIDI to Port 0 (or whichever you picked in step #2).
    - You could send patterns to a MIDI Out plugin, and set it to the appropriate port and channel you wish to send.    

        ![MIDI Out plugin set to same port](doc/midiout.png)
        
        NOTE: Turn on "Map Note color to MIDI Channel" if you want to map multiple channels to PianoShooter from one MIDI Out.

    - You could also use a Patcher in the Channel list to send the MIDI to both a MIDI Out plugin and your instrument.
    
        ![Patcher splitting MIDI to an instrument and a MIDI Out](doc/patcher.png)
 
5. For Player mode (where the notes move TO the keyboard), you'll need to send MIDI to the Visualizer before it goes to the instrument. 
    This can be done by duplicating tracks and offsetting them or by delaying the audio such that they sync.  
    See also the Preroll setting in PianoShooter - MIDI should be sent the same
    number of beats ahead of the audio as the Preroll is set to in Player mode.

Palette        | Several selections for different 16-color palettes for coloring notes and key lighting.
Piano          | Piano mode - Shooter: Notes emerge from the piano.  Player: Notes come towards the piano from a position based on Preroll
Preroll        | How many beats out the note starts from the keyboard.
Tempo          | Auto will attempt to autodetect the tempo. It's not perfect.  If you can select the nearest tempo below yours, then match it with Fine.
Fine           | Adjustment to tempo above - you may add from 0 to 9 BPM to Tempo.  Does not have an effect in Auto mode.
PianoLink      | If on, changes to most of the parameters will be immediately copied to other PianoShooter instances. This allows you to automate just one.

Camera Yaw     | Adjusts the camera's rotation and view around the keyboard.
Camera Pitch   | Adjusts the camera's pitch and view above the keyboard. Note that these (Yaw/Pitch) change BOTH camera rotation and position to keep the keyboard centered.
